# ⚠️ Do Not Edit `validators.json`

This file is auto-generated from individual validator metadata and keypair files. 

To add or update a validator, make your changes in `validators/<team>/` and open a pull request to `main`.  
Once merged, the tooling will regenerate `validators.json` automatically.
